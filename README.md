## Important Commands
---

Creating a react app.   Please note that there is a section on using templates to create
react apps (eg TypeScript), which is probably useful, but I haven't covered here yet:
```
npx create-react-app my-app         // creates npm project
or
npm init react-app my-app
or
yarn create react-app my-app
```

Useful commands:

```
npm install         yarn or yarn install
npm start           yarn start
npm test            yarn test           // runs test watcher
npm run build       yarn build          // builds app for prod in build folder
npm run dev         yarn dev
npm init            yarn init
npm run             yarn run
npm test            yarn test

Note:

So far, I have found that npm works on my computer, but not my work computer.   I can copy his code
and use ```yarn install``` followed by ```yarn run dev``` and it seems to work.
